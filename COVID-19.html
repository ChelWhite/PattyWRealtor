                    <strong>PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The way in which we service and transact real estate has changed, at least for today. Smart Group Realtors 
                    have remained fully operational with fully functioning remote workplaces established and consistent
                    protocols in place which have allowed safe and seamless operations. While our Nation continues to
                    persist through the challenges associated with COVID-19, the real estate market has quickly adapted
                    to the new procedures through which we safely practice real estate. We are deeply committed to do our part to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in our
                    community. As we immediately implemented effective and seamless remote and isolated office
                    operations, both The McEnery Company and McEnery Residential have aggressively supported and
                    encouraged the following general protocols during this interim condition in our market:


                    <br><br>
                    Virtual property tours conducted via FaceTime with commentary and as conducted by our agents with
                    restricted attendee counts.
                    We are continuing to maintain the suspension of open houses of any kind.
                    Home and apartment access arrangements, where permitted by ownership, by which the property will be
                    made accessible for buyer and agent/broker viewings without the necessity for a listing broker
                    present.
                    Appraisal site visits and tour times accommodative to ensuring a limited number of on-site attendees
                    and with a sensitivity toward all things safety, and in keeping with the guidance and
                    recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
                    <br><br>

                    Outside of the extreme priority to ensure we do our part to make a positive impact in our community
                    by not contributing to the spread of the virus, the most important role as real estate professionals
                    that we will continue to play in the coming weeks and months is to be a leader in how we effectively
                    service our clients needs during this transitional time in the markets. We will safely, attentively
                    and tirelessly work to service the needs of our clients.

                    <br><br>

                    If you have an interest in scheduling an appraisal order, have a general real estate question, or
                    require a private showing of one of our listings, please contact the appropriate team member. Most
                    importantly, please stay safe and healthy as we continue to monitor this interim market condition.


                    <br><br>
                    In the spirit of this new normal, we will regularly be providing video updates detailing our market
                    activity to our client base, with the most recent video being effective March 31, 2020.
